	<div><text2>It wasn't until they the people heard F*** Tha Police when the people really lost there mind. The FBI wrote a letter to the hip hop group stating that they could not say these things. But freedom of speech is a thing and they did not listen. More backlash came until a news story came on March 7, 1991. The Rodney King video of 5 cops beating on a black man. Police Brutality caught on camera during the time when N.W.A. has been talking about these issues. All of sudden people did not hate gangsta rap as much. People thought that N.W.A. was right this whole time. While this was happening the Rodney King trial began...  </text2></div>

	<div><text1>In the late 80's there was a rise in west coast hip hop. But on the west coast we did things differently. This led to the rise of gangsta rap and the rise of hip hop's most dangerous group. N.W.A. dropped an album in 1988, named "Straight Outta Compton". This album is one of the most influencial, and contervisal album in hip hop. At the time when this record dropped, Los Angeles was at the peak of gang violence. So this album began protests and hundreds and thousands of people to ban gangsta rap. Although this album recieved lots of hate, this album was a message from the black man who lives in south central or compton. This was an album that made big claims against things like police brutality and terrible life in poverty. </text1></div>

	<div><text3>1992 La riots. In 1992 the people have been familiar with the Rodney King trial for a year. Until one day the news had a live feed of the judge sentencing the cops who beat Rodney. Everyone is watching hoping that these cops get years in jail. Unfortunately the cops were charged not guilty. Which outraged the people and led to a huge riot in Los Angeles. People looting, killing, destroying all of L.A. This had a big impact because this all started with a hip hop album that most people were against. This is also just one incident of social justice within Hip Hop. There are plenty more but I felt like this is a very big one that happend not to long ago. </text3></div>
